# tor 

Tor is a simple terminal text editor. 

It's not stable or well coded, but usable for me. 

### Key Binding

Tor has different key binding set from other editors. 

Basically you could think `Ctrl` is for action, `Alt` is for move, `Shift` is for selection.

##### Ctrl

`Ctrl+W` Quit

`Ctrl+S` Save

`Ctrl+C` Copy

`Ctrl+Z` Undo

`Ctrl+V` Paste

`Ctrl+F` Find Mode

`Ctrl+D` Find Next

`Ctrl+B` Find Prev

`Ctrl+G` Goto Line

`Ctrl+N` New Line

`Ctrl+L` Select Line

`Ctrl+O` Indent Line

`Ctrl+U` Unintent Line


##### Alt

`Alt+J` Left

`Alt+L` Right

`Alt+I` Up

`Alt+K` Down

`Alt+U` Bigining Of Contents

`Alt+O` End Of Contents

`Alt+M` Prev Word Edge

`Alt+.` Next Word Edge

...And several other key maps, but they may changed frequently.
