It is a design document for tor.

Note that this is not a current implementation,
but it will change based on this design slowly.

I made this doc because I change code without much thinking.
I should not change code directly, but organize this first.


screen (singleton)
	size
	main area
	status area

	Resize(cell.Pt)


area
	size
	window

	Draw(text)
	DrawCursor(cursor)


modes
	normalmode
	findmode
	replacemode
	gotolinemode
	exitmode


mode
	area
	text
	cursor

	Handle(termbox.Ev) gets an event and modify it's text and cursor.
	Draw() draws it's text and cursor to area.


text
	lines


cursor
	text

	...() return result.


action
	Do() does it's job and return result.


actionResult
	Do() does itself again.
	Undo() undoes itself.
